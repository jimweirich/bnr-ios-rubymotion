# Big Nerd Ranch Guide to iOS Programming Example in RubyMotion

Here's my repository of worked examples to the projects in the [Big
Nerd Ranch Guide to iOS
programming](http://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Ranch-Guides-ebook/dp/B007OWBAB0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1338401105&sr=1-1).

These are my solutions and I am providing them for edification only.
I reserve the right to not implement the example completely, or change
the requirements on a whim, or even to skip entire chapters as it
suits my need. But if you are interested in digging around, feel free.

There is another Big Nerd Ranch RubyMotion repository done by [Jaime
Iniesta](//github.com/jaimeiniesta/rubymotion-nerd).  Make sure you
check that one out too.
